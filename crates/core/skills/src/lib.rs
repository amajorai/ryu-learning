//! **Agent Skill runtime** (M3, issue #145).
//!
//! This module owns the Core side of the Skills standard:
//! - SKILL.md parsing (YAML front-matter + Markdown body).
//! - [`SkillRecord`] — the real, executable Skill Runnable (replaces `SkillStub`).
//! - [`SkillRegistry`] — loads skills from the universal Agent Skills directories
//!   (overridable via `RYU_SKILLS_DIR`), plus the legacy flat `<id>.md` layout for
//!   back-compat. Two standard roots are scanned so a skill installed by *any*
//!   agent is detected:
//!     1. `~/.claude/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` — the Claude Code / skills-CLI location
//!        (also Ryu's own write/install target).
//!     2. `~/.agents/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` — the **vendor-neutral** Agent Skills
//!        directory the `agentskills.io` / `vercel-labs/skills` ecosystem installs
//!        into, and the exact path the managed Pi binary auto-loads. Detecting it
//!        means skills any tool dropped there work in Ryu with zero setup. Per the
//!        spec, root-level `.md` files under this dir are ignored (dirs only).
//!   On an id collision the first root (`~/.claude/skills`) wins.
//!
//! Core-vs-Gateway rule: Core decides *what skills run* (selection, loading,
//! instruction injection into the outgoing request body). The Gateway decides
//! *what is allowed / measured / paid* (budget, audit, firewall).  The Gateway
//! already calls `SkillsRegistry::inject` — that governs egress.  Core injects
//! skill instructions into the assembled request body *before* it is forwarded
//! to the Gateway, so the turn demonstrably changes (AC2) and the Gateway counts
//! the skill-tagged call toward budget/audit (AC3).

// the one-time legacy migration source (`~/.ryu/skills`). All of those live under
// Ryu's own data folder, which Core owns and can relocate. Rather than depend on
// `apps/core`, the crate reads the folder from a process-global set once at startup
// by Core (`ryu_skills::set_data_dir(paths::ryu_dir())`), mirroring how the moved
// `ryu_quests` engine is published via a `OnceLock`. When unset (crate-isolated
// unit tests) it falls back to the same default Core computes: `$RYU_DIR` or
// `~/.ryu`.

// ACP plane); the no-tool openai-compat fast path keeps full injection regardless,
// so a weak model is never starved (see `adapters::route_chat_stream`).

/// injected prefix differ between two identical turns — the same cache cost plus
/// irreproducible behaviour. Nothing is *lost* by the cut either: the trailing

    /// 2. [`parse_skill_md`] — a `SKILL.md` that is front-matter only (or that never
    ///    closes its front-matter) parses to an empty body; the *only* parse error is
    ///    a missing `name`. So the disk half can produce one too.

    /// the model in so many words to call `skills__load` with the id.
